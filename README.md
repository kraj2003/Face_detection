# 👁️ Face, Eye, and Mouth Detection using OpenCV

This project performs real-time detection of facial features (face, eyes, and mouth) using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers. It uses your webcam feed to identify and highlight these features with bounding boxes and labels.

---

## 📸 Demo

- Detects **faces** in real-time from webcam feed  
- Detects **eyes** and **mouth** within the face region  
- Displays labeled bounding boxes for better visualization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Library**: OpenCV  
- **Algorithm**: Haar Cascade Classifiers (pre-trained)
